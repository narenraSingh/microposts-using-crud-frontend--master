# Microposts(using crud frontend)

<br>
Microposts is a app to create a post or add your thoughts just like twitter. This app is based on pure javascript no libraries or frameworks, this app database is created using Json-Server api where i can add posts, delete posts, updates posts and more.

## Getting Started with the Microposts Project

<h4>Step 1:<h4>
  
 Clone the app or pull, then open the code in VS code, then open it with live server. 
  
<h4> Step 2: <h4>
  
 As this app backend is created using json-server we have to start a json server to run the various funconalities of app.
  
  So, start json server using command: npm run json:server in your terminal.
  
  So there you go now you can post the posts, delete them or update them in real time.
  
  ## Thanks!!
